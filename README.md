Homework 3 Notes
------------------


* mult.py ( Problem 1 ) works completely in accordance to the problem statement. 
* mult2.py (Problem 2 ) - Most of the features work, but there are some bugs. I plan to make corrections to the code as soon as possible.


UPDATE -
-----------------
* The second program runs flawlessly now. Found the error in the original code. The original code was trying to open the file twice which was causing the error. I resolved this issue by declaring the "input" argument as a string type, and then passing it down as a list to fileinput.

* I am remaining the original second program as mult2_original.py so that a comparison can be made between the codes.
